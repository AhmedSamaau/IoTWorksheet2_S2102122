# Morse Code

This is my code on implementing a communication protocol between two Micro:bits by using Morse code as a representation.



## How it works

1. First flash the MorseCode.hex file into the Micro:bit.
2. Connect the crocodile pins to pin1 and pin2 of both the Miro:bits.
3. Press the Button A for a duration below 250ms for it to register as a DOT.
4. Press the Button B for a duration below 500ms for it to register as a DASH.
5. After pressing DOT and DASH in your desired sequence it should show the corresponding character.
6. Shake the receiver Micro:bit to show the entire message.
